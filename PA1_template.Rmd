Unzip and Read the activity data

```{r}

unzip('activity.zip')
activity <- read.csv('activity.csv')
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
daily.steps <- with(activity, tapply(steps,date,sum))
hist(daily.steps)
mean.steps <- mean(daily.steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median.steps <- median(daily.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
activity.intervals <- with(activity, tapply(steps,interval,mean, na.rm=TRUE))

activity.intervals <- as.matrix(activity.intervals)

plot(activity.intervals ~ row.names(activity.intervals), type='l')

activity.intervals[which.max(activity.intervals),]
```

Imputing missing values
```{r}
summary(activity)


```


Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
